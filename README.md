# Consuming Linked Data Using PHP 

## Installation

### Step 1: Install from GitHub

In a Terminal Window

```bash
$ cd {YOUR-APACHE-DOCUMENT-ROOT}
$ git clone https://github.com/librarywebchic/c4l16_ld_php.git
$ cd c4l16_ld_php
```

### Step 2: Use composer to install the dependencies

```bash
$ curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
$ php composer.phar install
```

[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) is a dependency management library for PHP. It is used to install the required libraries for testing and parsing RDF data. The dependencies are configured in the file `composer.json`.

## Usage
